Introduction to Windows Phone
=============================

These are the slides and demos for a 2-3 hour workshop on Windows Phone. It begins by introducing the platform and then illustrates a basic application with data binding and navigation. Then, the demos move to web service integration with Windows Azure Mobile Services. The final demos explore the advanced features of Windows Phone, including location, maps, and speech commands.

In the middle of the workshop an [optional lab](http://s.sashag.net/wp8lab) can be given.
